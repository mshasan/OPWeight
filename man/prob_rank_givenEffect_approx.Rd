\title{Probability of rank of test given effect size by normal approximation}
\usage{
prob_rank_givenEffect_approx(
  k,
  et,
  ey,
  nrep = 10000,
  m0,
  m1,
  effectType = c("binary", "continuous")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{Integer, rank of a test}

\item{et}{Numeric, effect of the targeted test for importance sampling}

\item{ey}{Numeric, mean/median covariate efffect from external information}

\item{nrep}{Integer, number of replications for importance sampling}

\item{m0}{Integer, number of true null hypothesis}

\item{m1}{Integer, number of true alternative hypothesis}

\item{effectType}{Character ("continuous" or "binary"), type of effect sizes}
}
\value{
\code{prob} Numeric, probability of the rank of a test
}
\description{
A normal approximation to comnpute the probability of rank of a
test being higher than any other test given the effect size from external
information.
}
\details{
If one wants to test \deqn{H_0: epsilon_i=0 vs. H_a: epsilon_i > 0,}
then \code{ey} should be mean of the covariate effect sizes,
This is called hypothesis testing for the continuous effect sizes.\cr

If one wants to test \deqn{H_0: epsilon_i=0 vs. H_a: epsilon_i = epsilon,}
then \code{ey} should be median or any discrete value of the
covariate effect sizes. This is called hypothesis testing for the Binary
effect sizes.\cr

\code{m1} and \code{m0} can be estimated using \code{qvalue} from
a bioconductor package \code{qvalue}.
