\title{Probbaility of rank of test given effect size by exact method}
\usage{
prob_rank_givenEffect_exact(k, et, ey, nrep = 10000, m0, m1,
  effectType = c("binary", "continuous"))
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{rank of the tests}

\item{et}{actual data test effect for importance sampling}

\item{ey}{filter test efffect from external information}

\item{nrep}{number of replications for importance sampling}

\item{m0}{number of true null hypothesis}

\item{m1}{number of true alternative hypothesis}

\item{effectType}{type of effect size c("binary","continuous")}
}
\value{
\code{prob} probability of the rank of the test
}
\description{
An exact method to comnpute the probbaility of rank of a
test being higher than any other test given the effect size from external
information.
}
\details{
If one wants to test \deqn{H_0: epsilon_i=0 vs. H_a: epsilon_i > 0,}
then \code{et}  and \code{ey} should be mean of the test and filter effect sizes,
respectively. This is called hypothesis testing for the continuous effect sizes.
If one wants to test \deqn{H_0: epsilon_i=0 vs. H_a: epsilon_i = epsilon,}
then \code{et} and \code{ey} should be median or any discrete value of the
test and filter effect sizes. This is called hypothesis testing for the Binary
effect sizes.

\examples{
# compute the probability of rank for the third test
prob <- prob_rank_givenEffect_exact(k=3, et=0, ey=0, nrep=10000, m0=50, m1=50,
                                effectType= "continuous")

# compute the probabilities of rank for 1 to 100 tests
# do not compute probability for a large number of tests
ranks <- 1:100
prob <- sapply(ranks, prob_rank_givenEffect_exact, et=1, ey=1, nrep=10000,
                                 m0=50, m1=50, effectType = "continuous")
