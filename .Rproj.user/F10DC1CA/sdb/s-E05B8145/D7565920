The main property of these data is high-dimensionality, that is, the number of features is larger than the number of observations. There are many ways to study this kind of data, and multiple hypothesis testing is one of them. In a multiple hypothesis test, generally a list of pvalues $(p_i)$ are calculated, one for each hypothesis $(H_i)$ corresponding to one feature; the pvalues are then compared with one or more predefined fixed or random thresholds to obtain the number of significant features. The key goal is to control the Family Wise Error Rate ($FWER$) or False Discovery Rate ($FDR$) while maximizing the power of the tests. \n\nAlthough multiple hypothesis provides an platform to test many features simultaneously, it often requires high compensation for doing so [@stephens2016false]. To overcome from this shortcoming, [@benjamini1997false] shows a way of using the rank of the pvalues frequently termed as adjusted pvalues. However, this method solely depends on the pvalues and, therefore, provides only sub optimal power of the tests. An alternative approach is pvalue weighting in which external information is used in terms of weight and the actual pvalue is redefined by incorporating the weight, which is usually accomplished dividing the original pvalues by the corresponding weights and creating new pvalues called weighted pvalues, i.e., $p_i^{w_i} = \\frac{p_i}{w_i}$, where $p_i^{w_i}$ and $w_i$ refers to the weighted pvalues and the corresponding weight. This external information frequently referred as the filter statistics or the covariates $(y_i)$. The requirements of the method are that the covariates are assumed to be independent under the null hypothesis but informative for the power [@bourgon2010independent]. In addition, the weights must be non-negative, and the mean of the weights must be equal to $1$.\n\nGenerally, covariates provide different prior probabilities of the null hypotheses being true; therefore, a judiciously chosen covariate can significantly improve the power of the test while maintaining the error rate below the threshold. Such covariates are frequently available from various studies and data sets [@ignatiadis2016natmeth]. In this vignette, we discussed an application of a newly proposed method of pvalue weighting called Optimal Pvalue Weighting (OPW), which will soon appear in the journal. In the article, we showed how to compute an optimal weight of the pvalues without estimating the effect sizes of the tests. We showed that the weights can be computed by applying a probabilistic relationship of the ranking of the tests and the effect sizes. In regards to $OPW$ we developed an $R$ package named `r Biocpkg(\"OPWeight\")`, and we will discuss the application procedures of the functions of the package. To apply the function, the essential inputs are:\n\ni) a vector of pvalues\nii) a vector of filter statistics, where each value corresponds to a pvalue\niii) effect type: continuous or binary\niv) a significance level of $\\alpha$ at which FWER or FDR will be controlled\n\nand the auxiliary inputs are\n\ni) a vector of test statistics\nii) mean of the filter and test effects\n\n\nThe proposed $OPW$ method uses covariates to compute the probability of the ranks of the test statistics being higher than any other tests, $p(r_i \\mid \\varepsilon_i)$, then compute the weights from the probability corresponding to the pvalues. As an example, we will discuss an RNA-seq differential gene expression data called `r Biocpkg(\"airway\")` from the $R$ library `r Biocpkg(\"airway\")`. This data set is also used in the $IHW$ package vignettes [@ignatiadis2016natmeth].  \n\n\n# Airway RNA-seq data example\nWe fist preprocess the `r Biocpkg(\"airway\")` RNA-Seq data set using `r Biocpkg(\"DESeq2\")` [@love2014moderated] to obtain the pvalues, test statistics, and the covariates (filter statistics).\n\n```{r loadlibs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"airway\")\nlibrary(\"DESeq2\")\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(qvalue)\nlibrary(MASS)\n#data(\"airway\", package = \"airway\")\n#dds <- DESeqDataSet(se = airway, design = ~ cell + dex)\n#dds <- DESeq(dds)\n#de_res_air <- as.data.frame(results(dds))\nde_res_air <- data.frame(pvalue=runif(100), stat = rnorm(100), baseMean = sample(1:100))\n```\n\nThe output is a `r class(de_res_air)` object containing the following columns for each gene, where each gene corresponds to a hypothesis test:\n\n\n```{r colnames_de_res_air}\ncolnames(de_res_air)\ndim(de_res_air)\n```\nFrom the above columns, we will consider `baseMean` as the covariate. In the `r Biocpkg(\"DESeq2\")` paper, it has argued that the covariate `baseMean` and the test statistics (`stat`) are approximately independent under the null hypothesis, which fulfills the requirements of the `baseMean` to be the filter statistics. \n\nFirst load `r Biocpkg(\"OPWeight\")`:\n```{r loadihw, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(\"OPWeight\")\nopw_results <- opw(pvalue = de_res_air$pvalue, filter = de_res_air $baseMean, \n                  effectType = \"continuous\", method = \"BH\")\n```\nThe above plot shows the estimated $\\lambda$ of the box-cox transformation and the corresponding $log-likelihood.$\n\nThe executed function returns a list of objects:\n\n```{r}\nnames(opw_results)\n```\nFor example, the estimated proportion of the true null hypothesis:\n\n```{r}\nopw_results$propNulls\n```\n\nThe number of rejected null hypothesis: \n\n```{r}\nopw_results$rejections\n```\n\nThe plot of the probability of the ranks of the test statistics, $P(r_i \\mid \\varepsilon_i)$, and the corresponding weights:\n\n```{r}\nm = opw_results$totalTests\nranks = 1:m\nprobs = opw_results$ranksProb\nweights = opw_results$weight\ndat = data.frame(ranks, probs, weights)\np_prob = ggplot(dat, aes(x = ranks, y = probs)) + geom_line(size=1.5, col=\"firebrick4\") + \n    labs(y = \"p(rank | effect)\")\np_weight = ggplot(dat, aes(x = ranks, y = weights)) + geom_line(size=1.5, col=\"firebrick4\")\ngrid.arrange(p_prob, p_weight, ncol = 2)\n```\n\nIf one wants to test $H_0: \\varepsilon_i=0$ vs. $H_0: \\varepsilon_i > 0$, i.e., the effect sizes follow continuous distribution, then one should use `effectType = \"continuous\"`. Similarly, if one wants to test $H_0: \\varepsilon_i=0$ vs. $H_0: \\varepsilon_i=\\varepsilon$, i.e., effect sizes are binary; $0$ under the null model and a fixed value $\\varepsilon$ under the alternative model, one should use `effectType = \"binary\"`. $opw()$ function can provide results based on $FDR$ or $FWER$, and default method is Benjamini-Hochberg [@benjamini1997false] $FDR$ method.\n\nIn order to apply our method, it is crucial to understand the uses of the parameters `test`, `mean_filterEffect` and `mean_testEffect`. If the test statistics are provided, and `mean_filterEffect` and `mean_testEffect` are not provided then the supplied test statistics will be used to compute the relationship between the filter statistics and the test statistics; otherwise, `pvalue` will be used to compute the test statistics, and those test statistics will be considered as one-tailed test statistics. Then, by applying the relationship model the `mean_filterEffect` and `mean_testEffect` will be computed. If `mean_filterEffect` and `mean_testEffect` are provided then the test statistics are not necessary at all. However, if one of the mean effects are not given, then the missing mean effect will be computed internally. In addition, for the the two-tailed test, one must need to provide the information of the tail by `tail=2`.   \n\nThere are many ways to obtain the mean of the test effects (`mean_testEffect`) and the corresponding value of the filter effects (`mean_filterEffect`); however, in the proposed $R$ function $opw()$, we used a simple linear regression with $box-cox$ transformation, where filter statistics are regressed on the test statistics. Sometimes the $box-cox$ transformation may not be the optimal choice or one wants to use a different model to obtain the relationship. In that situation, one can acquire the relationship between the filter and test effect sizes externally and provide `mean_filterEffect` and `mean_testEffect` to perform the proposed optimal pvalue weighting. In the following section, we will show the details analysis procedure.\n\n# Data analysis\n\nBefore applying the function let's perform a pre-screening analysis of the data set. Consider the above data set. First make some plots based on the filter statistics, test statistics, and the pvalues.\n\n```{r}\nData <- tibble(test=de_res_air$stat, pval=de_res_air$pvalue, filter=de_res_air$baseMean)\n\nbarlines <- \"#1F3552\"\n\nhist_test <- ggplot(Data, aes(x = Data$test)) +\n        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1,\n\t  colour = barlines, fill = \"#4271AE\") +\n\t\tlabs(x = \"test statistics\")\n\nhist_pval <- ggplot(Data, aes(x = Data$pval)) +\n        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),\n\t  colour = barlines, fill = \"#4281AE\")+\n\t\tlabs(x = \"pvalues\")\n\nhist_filter <- ggplot(Data, aes(x = Data$filter)) +\n        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),\n\t  colour = barlines, fill = \"#4274AE\") +\n\t\tlabs(x = \"filter statistics\")\n\ntest_filter <- ggplot(Data, aes(x = Data$test, y = Data$filter)) +\n\t\tgeom_point() + labs(x = \"test statstics\", y = \"filter statistics\")\n\t\t#scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 25000), breaks=seq(0, 25000, 10000))\n\npval_filter <- ggplot(Data, aes(x = rank(-Data$filter), y = -log10(pval))) +\n\t\tgeom_point()+\n\t\tlabs(x = \"ranks of filters\", y = \"-log(pvalue)\")\n\t\t#scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 25000), breaks=seq(0, 25000, 10000))\n\np_ecdf <- ggplot(Data, aes(x = pval)) +\n\t\t\tstat_ecdf(geom = \"step\")+\n\t\t\tlabs(x = \"pvalues\", title=\"empirical cumulative distribution\")+\n\t\t\ttheme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(.7)))\n\n\ngrid.arrange(hist_test,  hist_pval, hist_filter, test_filter , pval_filter, p_ecdf, \n\t\tncol = 3, heights = c(7, 7), top = \"Airway: data summary\")\n\n```\nPre-analysis Figure: the first row shows the distribution of the test statistics, filter statistics and the pvalues, and the second row shows the relationship between the filter and test statistics, the relationship between the pvalues and the rank of the filter statistics, and the empirical cumulative distribution of the pvalues, respectively.\n\nFrom the pre-analysis plots, we see the distribution of the filter statistics is rightly skewed; therefore, to perform a linear regression the filter statistics need to be transformed. In $opw()$ function, we used $box-cox$ transformation. However, one can perform another transformation, such as $log(filter)$, and fit a simple linear regression model, r any other criteria to obtain the relationship. For example, generalized linear model. Although the transformed distribution may not be still suitable, this may not be a severe problem because the proposed method only requires the center of the distribution.\n\nWe also observe from the plot that there is a weak relationship between the test statistics and the filter statistics; however, the ranked-filter statistics show potential relationships with the pvalues, i.e., low pvalues are enriched at the higher filter statistics. This relationship might be informative for the pvalue-weighting because we are more interested in the ranking of the filter statistics. Enrichment of the low pvalues at higher filter statistics also indicates that the filter statistics is correlated with power under the alternative model. Furthermore, the bimodal distribution of the pvalues indicates two-tailed test criteria are necessary because pvalues close to $1$ be the cases that are significant in the opposite direction. We also observed the empirical cumulative distribution of the pvalues. The empirical cumulative distribution shows that the curve is almost linear for the high pvalues, which reveals the lesser importance of the higher pvalues, and the size of the low pvalues is very small.\n\nNow we first fit a linear regression with $box-cox$ transformation and obtain the estimated `mean_filterEffect` and `mean_fulterEffect` in the following:\n\n```{r}\n# fite box-cox regression\n#--------------------------------\nm = length(Data$pval)\nnull = qvalue(Data$pval, pi0.method=\"bootstrap\")$pi0\nm0 = ceiling(null*m)\nm1 = m - m0\n\nbc <- boxcox(Data$filter ~ Data$test, plotit = FALSE)\ntrans <- bc$x[which.max(bc$y)]\nmodel <- lm(Data$filter^trans ~ Data$test)\n\ntest_effect = if(m1 == 0) {0\n} else {sort(abs(Data$test), decreasing = T)[1:m1]}\t\t# two-tailed test\n\n# for the continuous effects \nmean_testEffect = mean(test_effect, na.rm = T)\nmean_filterEffect = model$coef[[1]] + model$coef[[2]]*mean_testEffect\n\n# for the binary effects \nmean_testEffect = median(test_effect, na.rm = T)\nmean_filterEffect = model$coef[[1]] + model$coef[[2]]*mean_testEffect\n```\nThe above procedure in performed by the $opw()$ function internally by default; however, if one wants to try different approach such as fitting a linear regression using $log-transformation$ instead of the $box-cox$ transformation, one needs to use `model <- lm(log(baseMean) ~ stat)` to obtain the estimated mean effects.\n\nIn order to obtain the mean effects, we compute the predicted value of the filter statistics corresponding to the mean or median of the test statistics. The mean or median value of the test statistics is then used as the estimated `mean_testEffect` and the corresponding predicted value of the filter statistics is used as the estimated `mean_filterEffect`.\n\n# Other functions\n\nIn the package `r Biocpkg(\"OPweight\")`, there are other useful functions: 1) `prob_rank_givenEffect`, 2) `weight_binary`, 3) `weight_continuous`,  4) `prob_rank_givenEffect_approx`, 5) `prob_rank_givenEffect_exact`, and 6) `prob_rank_givenEffect_simu`. First three functions are used inside the main function $opw()$; however, the remaining three functions are provided if any one wants to see the behavior of the probability of the rank of the test statistics, $p(r_i \\mid \\varepsilon_i)$. In the original, article we proposed the probability method and showed an exact mathematical formula then verify the formula by simulations. The exact method requires intensive computation; therefore we proposed an approximation. By applying the later three functions one can easily observe that all there methods performs similarly. However, for a large number of test the simulation and the exact approach are computationally very slow; therefore the approximations method is a better options. In fact, we actually need $p(r_i \\mid E(\\varepsilon_i))$ that is obtained by the function `prob_rank_givenEffect`.
