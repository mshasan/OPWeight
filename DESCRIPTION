Description: This package perform weighted-pvalue based multiple hypothesis test 
    and provides corresponding information such as ranking probability, weight, 
    significant tests, etc . To conduct this testing procedure, the testing 
    method apply a probabilistic relationship between the test rank and the 
    corresponding test effect size.
